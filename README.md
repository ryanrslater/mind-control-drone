# Mind Control Drone

The goal of this is to build a Drone that can be controlled with my thoughts, to achieve this I will be using the Tello Ryze Drone and the Insight 5 EEG machine from Emotiv.

In order for this to work you'll need to connect to the Drones WiFi, have installed the Emotiv Installer and setup your EEG machine with the mental commands.
